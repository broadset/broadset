### Unit 1.0 — Gradient Editor As Shared Primitive

**Decision:** Implement `GradientEditor` as a reusable input primitive in `packages/ui/src/inputs/` instead of embedding gradient editing logic directly inside an appearance panel component.
**Alternatives considered:**

1. Keep gradient controls panel-local in `property-panels/layout-panels.tsx` (faster short-term, but duplicates behavior and tests later).
2. Keep raw gradient text input and defer visual editing to a later unit (violates the plan's art-director UX constraints).
   **Rationale:** Unit 1 is the primitives foundation for later panel units. A dedicated primitive centralizes drag-stop logic, angle control, and minimum-stop constraints, and lets later panel work compose behavior instead of re-implementing it.
